`Microsoft Azure`, `Hashicorp Terraform`, `Infrastructure as Code`, `Azure resource management`, `Cloud infrastructure management`

## üí° Motivation

I suddenly got inspired to learn more about cloud infrastructure management and how to use automation tools to simplify and streamline the process of deploying and managing cloud resources after completing `Terraform + AWS course` on Udemy (btw, liked it!).

In the course, I was doing small tasks to understand how to create different resources separately and the overall power of Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, but I wanted to combine my knowledge and build something whole!

I chose to build a dev environment in Azure, so I could practice managing cloud resources and learn more about Azure, which I had no exposure to earlier!

## Learned

I gained hands-on experience with Terraform and Azure (I played around first placing everything in one `main.tf` and later structuring it better for reusability; working with modules and connecting the resources), and developed a solid foundation for working with these technologies. This has inspired me to continue exploring the world of cloud infrastructure management and automation.

- Terraform (modules, data sources, custom_data, file, provisioner, templatefile, etc)
- Using external scripts
- Azure Resource management (SG Association, Linux VM, etc)
- Cloud Infrastructure Management
